# Implementation status

This is the only mutable project-status document.

## Current state

- **State:** C2_COMPLETE_C3_ACTIVE
- **Current checkpoint:** C3
- **Live orders:** impossible by default
- **Production credentials:** not present and not requested
- **Current Wave 1:** Binance USD-M, Bybit, OKX
- **Canary default:** Bybit + OKX, subject to runtime qualification

## Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| C0 lean bootstrap | COMPLETE | [GitHub Actions run 31835084239](https://github.com/brullik/interexchange-perp-grid/actions/runs/31835084239): `make verify` and Docker health/restart smoke passed on commit `c240ea3` |
| C1 public market vertical slice | COMPLETE | [GitHub Actions run 31837867113](https://github.com/brullik/interexchange-perp-grid/actions/runs/31837867113): Linux `make verify` (29 tests) and Docker health/restart passed on `a790344`; live read-only scan found 656 common instruments and two eligible Binance USD-M/OKX directed BTC routes while Bybit failed closed with `BOOK_SEQUENCE_UNKNOWN`; Parquet/DuckDB replay contained 206 L2 levels across all three venues |
| C2 strategy/risk/simulator | COMPLETE | [GitHub Actions run 31839163485](https://github.com/brullik/interexchange-perp-grid/actions/runs/31839163485): Linux `make verify` (43 tests) and Docker health/restart passed on `0849413`; deterministic tests cover open/add/partial close/full close, profitable and losing four-leg PnL, funding, protected prices, partial/rejected/unknown orders, private staleness, venue outage, third-venue hedge, forced close, and property-based 5/50 USDT risk invariants |
| C3 usable shadow product | IN_PROGRESS | Continuous evaluator, persisted reconciliation, overload controls, Telegram operations, and qualification evidence are next |
| C4 live-canary-ready execution | NOT_STARTED | — |
| C5 owner-operated canary | BLOCKED_BY_DESIGN | Requires owner credentials and explicit live consent |
| C6 venue expansion | NOT_STARTED | — |

## Decisions made during implementation

Append only short entries:

```text
YYYY-MM-DD — decision — reason — affected modules
```

2026-08-14 — Persist service heartbeat and restart count in SQLite WAL — Docker health must prove the application loop is alive and restart-safe — `state.py`, `service.py`, CLI, Compose
2026-08-14 — Use `ccxt.pro.binance` future transport for Binance USD-M — the `binanceusdm` Pro class lacked the required WebSocket capabilities in an automated probe — `ccxt_pro.py`
2026-08-14 — Quarantine books with unknown sequence and continue with remaining qualified venues — fail-closed market data must not stop the Wave 1 process — `market_data.py`, `public_engine.py`
2026-08-14 — Calibrate median/MAD grids independently per directed route and size bucket with a 20% update bound — outliers and abrupt parameter jumps must not destabilise entries — `strategy.py`
2026-08-14 — Reserve route, portfolio, and venue risk atomically before simulated submission — every accepted action must preserve the 5/50 USDT, local-margin, leverage, route, and tranche limits — `risk.py`, `execution.py`

## Active blockers / owner actions

None. Codex must continue C0–C4 without production secrets.

## Last verified command

```text
GitHub Actions run 31839163485 on 0849413:
- make verify: PASS (Ruff, mypy, 43 pytest tests, doctor)
- docker-smoke: PASS (build, health, persisted restart count)
- deterministic C2 replay: PASS (open, add, partial/full close, profit/loss/funding, disconnects and recovery)
- property risk tests: PASS (accepted reservations preserve route <= 5 USDT and portfolio <= 50 USDT)
```
